Exercise 1:

Question: 

Explain the purpose of unit tests in the context of the `addBook` and 
`removeBook` functions in bookManager.js. 

How do unit tests fit into the software development lifecycle for this module?

Answer:

Unit tests check that the addBook and removeBook functions work as expected on their own.
They help find bugs early, keep the code reliable, and make it easier to update later.

In the development process, unit tests are written while building the code to make sure everything works correctly. 
They also support automated testing in continuous integration and delivery.
