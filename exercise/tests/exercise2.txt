Exercise 2:

Question: 

Describe the differences between manual testing and automated unit testing for 
the `findBooksByAuthor` function. 

What are the benefits of using automated tests in this case?


Answer:

Manual Testing: 
This involves running the program, manually calling findBooksByAuthor with different inputs, and checking the results by hand.
 It's slow, prone to mistakes, and needs to be redone whenever the code changes.

Automated Unit Testing:
 You create a test script (e.g. with Jest) that automatically runs findBooksByAuthor with various inputs and verifies the results. These tests are quick, repeatable, and can run every time the code is updated.
