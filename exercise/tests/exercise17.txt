Exercise 17:

Question: 

Discuss the importance of code coverage thresholds and how they 
enforce code quality in a project like bookManager.js.

Answer:

Code coverage thresholds set minimum acceptable coverage levels, 
encouraging developers to write sufficient tests. 

They prevent code with inadequate testing from being merged, 
promoting high code quality and ensuring reliability. 

In bookManager.js, setting thresholds ensures that key functionalities are 
thoroughly tested.
