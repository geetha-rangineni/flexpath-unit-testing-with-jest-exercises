Exercise 16:

Question: 

Explain how code coverage metrics like statement, branch, function, 
and line coverage help in assessing code quality for bookManager.js.

ANswer:
 Statement Coverage: Ensures that all executable statements are tested.
 Branch Coverage: Checks that every possible path (if/else) has been executed.
 Function Coverage: Verifies that all functions have been called in tests.
 Line Coverage: Similar to statement coverage but measures actual lines executed.
 These metrics help identify untested parts of the code, ensuring that 
critical functionality is verified and reducing the risk of bugs.
